# DIPLOMA PLUS IN WEB DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT - ASSIGNMENT 3
The third and final project which I had done for the Diploma Plus Program.

This is a fully functioning online library (for borrowing books!)  written on the Laravel framework. This project includes:
- Admin management system
- Database Models and Seeders
- Secure Authentication system
- Search and Category function

This project features heavy improvements when compared to my first project done in the Diploma Plus Program.
